## FACIAL EMOTION DETECTION TO ASSESS LEARNERSâ€™ STATE OF MIND IN AN ONLINE LEARNING SYSTEM

## Due to the COVID-19 pandemic's severe effects, physical classrooms have been closed and
teaching techniques have been switched to the online environment. Making ensuring that
students are properly engaged throughout online learning sessions is crucial if we want to
make the learning environment more dynamic, similar to that of conventional offline
classrooms. While the primary shortcoming of the online technique is the teacher's lack of
feedback on the students' learning progress. In order to determine an online learner's level of
involvement in the moment, this study suggests a deep learning-based method based on
facial expressions. The goal of this study was to offer techniques for determining students'
moods using online video conferencing.
Human emotions, on the other hand, are a great deal more complicated, and these
psychological states could not be expressed just by a learner's fundamental emotions like
anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and neutral. However, it is possible to take into
account a mixture of two or more emotions that may appear on the face over time. We shall
derive four complex emotions that are a composite of fundamental human emotions such as
confusion, satisfaction, disappointment and frustration that a learner frequently experiences
in concert throughout a learning session. Instead of discrete pictures, we thought about using
a fixed set of continuous image frames to represent these linked emotions. Using a CNN
model, we will classify the fundamentals before identifying the learners' emotional states of
mind.
